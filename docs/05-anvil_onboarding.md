# AnVIL Workspace



You can easily access the data on AnVIL by cloning the dedicated workspace. These sections guide you through creating an AnVIL account and accessing the workspace.


## Create Google Account


If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, [create one now](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow [these instructions](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611).

## Create Workspace


1. [Launch Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces)

1. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to "Workspaces". Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click "Workspaces".

The &quot;hamburger&quot; button to extend the drop-down menu is highlighted, and the menu item &quot;Workspaces&quot; is highlighted." width="480" />

1. Click on the **plus icon** near the top of left of the page.

1. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project.  **All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project** (regardless of who conducted it).

The text box labeled &quot;Workspace name&quot; and the drop-down menu labeled &quot;Billing project&quot; are highlighted." width="480" />

1. If you are working with protected data, you can set the **Authorization Domain** to limit who can be added to your Workspace.  Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future).  Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with.  Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated.  We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data).  For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated.

1. Click "CREATE WORKSPACE".  The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces.
